### Build

### Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). The tests will automatically watch your files and re-run when any changes are detected.

### Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
